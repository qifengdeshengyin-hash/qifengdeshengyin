Due to the short project duration, current progress is limited; thus, only interim results from the exploratory phase are summarized: 1. Bioinformatics related methods (GitHub link provided); 2. To clarify the analytical logic and research findings, simply describe the oligo pool synthesis, vector construction, and MPRA experimental design; 3. Data quality assessment; 4. System validation: activity and enrichment scores to verify control separation; 5. Activity formula calibration: revised activity calculation formula to address negative correlation with DNA data.
